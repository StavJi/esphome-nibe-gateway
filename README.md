# ESPHome NIBE Gateway

This project allows you to integrate your NIBE SMO40 and other NIBE heat pumps with **[ProDino ESP32 Ethernet](https://kmpelectronics.eu/shop/prodino-esp32-ethernet/)**, running `gateway.yaml` as a gateway, similar to the original NIBE MOSBUS40 accessory. It works with official [Home Assistant integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/nibe_heatpump).
